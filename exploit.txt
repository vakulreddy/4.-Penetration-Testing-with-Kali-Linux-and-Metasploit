Introduction:
The main objective was to take control of the computer and collect any useful data that could be present. The Metasploit framework and Kali Linux were used to carry out the test. The test was administered in accordance with the conditions and guidelines specified in the assignment.

steps 
1.
 The nmap scan was used as the initial stage in the penetration test to identify Skip's machine's IP address. Using Metasploit, a full TCP port scan was carried out, including version ID, and data was logged in the database. The top 1000 ports were also subjected to a UDP port scan, with the results being stored in the database. The operating system and services that were running on Skip's virtual machine were identified using Metasploit's nmap tool.
2.
The penetration test's following stage involved investigating and analyzing the vulnerabilities found in the previous step to find any that might be vulnerable to attack. On Skip's computer, there were numerous user accounts, and some keys were found scattered about. The Can You Hack It VM was thoroughly scanned by OpenVAS, and the results were exported in XML format, which was afterwards imported into the Metasploit workspace.
3.
ToÂ gain root level access to Skip's computer, Metasploit was utilized to take advantage of the flaws found in the earlier stage. A service that offered a meterpreter shell that wasn't a native Windows meterpreter was taken advantage of using a metasploit exploit. A native Windows meterpreter was uploaded and launched to complete the necessary task. Additionally, a binary (.exe) reverse (meterpreter) shell was produced using msfvenom. Some of the password hashes were cracked using Metasploit's tools, while others were cracked using web resources
4.
ToCollecting any valuable files or information, such as ssh keys, database contents with passwords, etc., was the last part of the penetration test. The finaldb.xml file included the exported data from the Metasploit database. The Metasploit exploit(s) that were utilized to acquire root access to the computer were documented in an exploit.txt file.

conclusion:
ToThe penetration test was effective in accessing Skip's computer at the root level and obtaining important data. The exam showed that the participants could plan out and put conventional guidelines and procedures into operation for a real-world penetration testing engagement. It also demonstrated how Kali Linux and its standard toolkit, which includes Metasploit, were used effectively to carry out the engagement.
